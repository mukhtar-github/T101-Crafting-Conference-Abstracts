### Crafting Conference Abstracts Introduction

My name is Greg, and for the past eight years I've worked with the Technical speakers at *MongoDB*. The program that we developed over the years has proven to be very effective at helping speakers of all levels of experience to do outstanding work at the conferences. You should never feel like you're alone in the process as you prepare your talk, ther's alot of resources in place to help you generate and deliver a fantastic talk.  This workshop is just a place to begin.

This modules is one we've done for three or four years, we think it's been a successful resource whether you're very experienced conference speaker or this is your first talk. So we wanted to offer it as a video module so you can engage with it at a time and a pace that suits you. To give you an analogy, one thing we talk about alot when we talk abut *Atlas* is the fact that when you run *MongoDB* in the Cloud with  *Atlas*, you are getting more than 10 years of experience running *MongoDB* baked into the technology.

I'd like to think that what we're doing here with your talk is an analogous to that. This brief workshop has eight years of observation and experimentation about what makes a great technical talk baked into it. It's supposed to help you get the creative juices flowing, and get you oriented towards the right way of thinking about your talk. This workshop, specifically is designed to help you write a compelling abstract, and the reason for that is pretty simple and it's a little mundane. Operationally, your abstract is one of the first deliverables for your talk, because the abstract helps the conference team ggin to organize a coherence schedule for the conference, and different technical tracks of the show.

Ofcourse, you could argue that one should make a great talk first and then write the abstract. Now, that may be true, but what's nice about this brief workshop is that, it'll get you thinking deeply about your content in addition to giving you a solid start on writing a great abstract. The workshop is pretty simple, I'll be guiding you through a series of questions that are meant to provoke your thinking and unlock your creativity. You'll want to have some way of capturing your ideas on Notepad, your Laptop, a whiteboard or even just a voice recorder, whatever works best for you.
