## Chapter 1: Create Your Session Title & Abstract

### Crafting Conference Abstracts Introduction

My name is Greg, and for the past eight years I've worked with the Technical speakers at *MongoDB*. The program that we developed over the years has proven to be very effective at helping speakers of all levels of experience to do outstanding work at the conferences. You should never feel like you're alone in the process as you prepare your talk, ther's alot of resources in place to help you generate and deliver a fantastic talk.  This workshop is just a place to begin.

This modules is one we've done for three or four years, we think it's been a successful resource whether you're very experienced conference speaker or this is your first talk. So we wanted to offer it as a video module so you can engage with it at a time and a pace that suits you. To give you an analogy, one thing we talk about alot when we talk abut *Atlas* is the fact that when you run *MongoDB* in the Cloud with  *Atlas*, you are getting more than 10 years of experience running *MongoDB* baked into the technology.

I'd like to think that what we're doing here with your talk is an analogous to that. This brief workshop has eight years of observation and experimentation about what makes a great technical talk baked into it. It's supposed to help you get the creative juices flowing, and get you oriented towards the right way of thinking about your talk. This workshop, specifically is designed to help you write a compelling abstract, and the reason for that is pretty simple and it's a little mundane. Operationally, your abstract is one of the first deliverables for your talk, because the abstract helps the conference team ggin to organize a coherence schedule for the conference, and different technical tracks of the show.

Ofcourse, you could argue that one should make a great talk first and then write the abstract. Now, that may be true, but what's nice about this brief workshop is that, it'll get you thinking deeply about your content in addition to giving you a solid start on writing a great abstract. The workshop is pretty simple, I'll be guiding you through a series of questions that are meant to provoke your thinking and unlock your creativity. You'll want to have some way of capturing your ideas, on Notepad, your Laptop, a whiteboard or even just a voice recorder, whatever works best for you.

So, if you haven't already, why dont't you take a minute to grab somthing to capture your thoughts and ideas. And then, you can begin to work through the segments at your own pace. By the of this module, we hope you will have everything you need to bang out of first draft, we call it a "Beta Version" of your abstract. So when you're ready go to the next segment and we'll dive in.

### Who are you?

The first thing I'd like to you to think about is you. How do you define yourself from the standpoint of technical culture? What I mean is, are there *specific communities or areas of expertise, languages, or things you're just super into, that are some of the ways you think about yourself in the various jobs and ecosystems that you inhabit*? Now, you may be wondering why this matters, and the answer is pretty simple. You're giving a talk and it's about something, and we hope the audience will be interested in that topic, of course.

I mean, who wouldn't be interested in *indexing strategies from MongoDB*, or *the principles of schema design*? But the audience is going to be hearing from you about that, and so there will always be a question for them about who you are, and if you're like them, and what you're all about. So let's get that out of the way right now. Who are you technically? What are you all about? Go ahead and take a few moments to think about that and capture anything that pops into your head, and then come on back for the next question.

### What are you curious about?

OK, great. You've captured some specific thinking about who you are, and now I want you to think about the topic of your talk. You can define that as narrowly or as broadly as you like, of course. We'll worry about pitching the talk at the right technical depth in a little while. But for right now, all I'm interested in is what are you interested in? You have to give the talk.

What's curious or cool or compelling to you about this topic? Hopefully there will be something about the topic that is interesting -- not always, but we'll deal with that later. For now, just capture any questions that you have about the topic. What's interesting about it? And let's remember to think about a few more things. What are some obvious questions that you can imagine people asking about the topic? Any things which most people might want to know. And then, after you've written that down, flip it on its head.

What are the questions no one asks about the topic, but should? What are the questions that aren't obvious? Sometimes those can be the most important. What's interesting to you, and what kinds of questions can you imagine other people asking? Take a couple of minutes to capture some of these questions.

* What are the obvious questions about this topic?
* What are the *not* obvious questions about this topic that people haven't thought to ask?

Go ahead and capture some of that, and then come on back for the next question.

### What is your point of view?

All right. Great. So we've looked at you, and we've looked at what you're curious about, and what *common and uncommon questions* people might have about the topic. Now, I want you to do something which is incredibly important. It's something that even experienced *MongoDB speakers* can miss. But it's a critical ingredient, not only of the abstract, but also of the talk itself.

> What is your point of view about the topic?

In other words, if I say, OK, folks, this is a talk about *transactions*, then a *classic point of view* might be, in *MongoDB, transactions should be the exception, not the rule*. So *this talk is going to be about when to use transactions, but it's important to understand when not to use them*. So in this case, the topic is *transactions*. But *the idea we're selling is use transactions responsibly, not habitually*.

So this is so important. I really can't stress this enough. Years of feedback from audiences has confirmed this for us. *MongoDB audiences* love deeply technical talks. But the ones that are rated the highest always have *a clearly expressed point of view about the topic set*. So now is the time *to start to uncover that point of view*. You probably have *biases, preferences, ideologies, recommendations, and/or philosophies that relate to the topic*, so what are those?

You might think of this as the *so what of the talk*. You can have *a deep, technical, memorable, well-crafted presentation, but if you don't have any point of view, if it isn't opinionated* -- we've seen over and over again -- the talk will lack impact for the audience. So take some time *to think about your point of view on the topic*. Can you express that simply and powerfully? Take a few minutes with this one. It's often *the difference between a good talk and an exceptional one*.
