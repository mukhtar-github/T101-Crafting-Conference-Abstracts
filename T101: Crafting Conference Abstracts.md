## Chapter 1: Create Your Session Title & Abstract

### Crafting Conference Abstracts Introduction

My name is Greg, and for the past eight years I've worked with the Technical speakers at *MongoDB*. The program that we developed over the years has proven to be very effective at helping speakers of all levels of experience to do outstanding work at the conferences. You should never feel like you're alone in the process as you prepare your talk, ther's alot of resources in place to help you generate and deliver a fantastic talk.  This workshop is just a place to begin.

This modules is one we've done for three or four years, we think it's been a successful resource whether you're very experienced conference speaker or this is your first talk. So we wanted to offer it as a video module so you can engage with it at a time and a pace that suits you. To give you an analogy, one thing we talk about alot when we talk abut *Atlas* is the fact that when you run *MongoDB* in the Cloud with  *Atlas*, you are getting more than 10 years of experience running *MongoDB* baked into the technology.

I'd like to think that what we're doing here with your talk is an analogous to that. This brief workshop has eight years of observation and experimentation about what makes a great technical talk baked into it. It's supposed to help you get the creative juices flowing, and get you oriented towards the right way of thinking about your talk. This workshop, specifically is designed to help you write a compelling abstract, and the reason for that is pretty simple and it's a little mundane. Operationally, your abstract is one of the first deliverables for your talk, because the abstract helps the conference team ggin to organize a coherence schedule for the conference, and different technical tracks of the show.

Ofcourse, you could argue that one should make a great talk first and then write the abstract. Now, that may be true, but what's nice about this brief workshop is that, it'll get you thinking deeply about your content in addition to giving you a solid start on writing a great abstract. The workshop is pretty simple, I'll be guiding you through a series of questions that are meant to provoke your thinking and unlock your creativity. You'll want to have some way of capturing your ideas, on Notepad, your Laptop, a whiteboard or even just a voice recorder, whatever works best for you.

So, if you haven't already, why dont't you take a minute to grab somthing to capture your thoughts and ideas. And then, you can begin to work through the segments at your own pace. By the of this module, we hope you will have everything you need to bang out of first draft, we call it a "Beta Version" of your abstract. So when you're ready go to the next segment and we'll dive in.

### Who are you?

The first thing I'd like to you to think about is you. How do you define yourself from the standpoint of technical culture? What I mean is, are there *specific communities or areas of expertise, languages, or things you're just super into, that are some of the ways you think about yourself in the various jobs and ecosystems that you inhabit*? Now, you may be wondering why this matters, and the answer is pretty simple. You're giving a talk and it's about something, and we hope the audience will be interested in that topic, of course.

I mean, who wouldn't be interested in *indexing strategies from MongoDB*, or *the principles of schema design*? But the audience is going to be hearing from you about that, and so there will always be a question for them about who you are, and if you're like them, and what you're all about. So let's get that out of the way right now. Who are you technically? What are you all about? Go ahead and take a few moments to think about that and capture anything that pops into your head, and then come on back for the next question.

### What are you curious about?

OK, great. You've captured some specific thinking about who you are, and now I want you to think about the topic of your talk. You can define that as narrowly or as broadly as you like, of course. We'll worry about pitching the talk at the right technical depth in a little while. But for right now, all I'm interested in is what are you interested in? You have to give the talk.

What's curious or cool or compelling to you about this topic? Hopefully there will be something about the topic that is interesting -- not always, but we'll deal with that later. For now, just capture any questions that you have about the topic. What's interesting about it? And let's remember to think about a few more things. What are some obvious questions that you can imagine people asking about the topic? Any things which most people might want to know. And then, after you've written that down, flip it on its head.

What are the questions no one asks about the topic, but should? What are the questions that aren't obvious? Sometimes those can be the most important. What's interesting to you, and what kinds of questions can you imagine other people asking? Take a couple of minutes to capture some of these questions.

* What are the obvious questions about this topic?
* What are the *not* obvious questions about this topic that people haven't thought to ask?

Go ahead and capture some of that, and then come on back for the next question.

### What is your point of view?

All right. Great. So we've looked at you, and we've looked at what you're curious about, and what *common and uncommon questions* people might have about the topic. Now, I want you to do something which is incredibly important. It's something that even experienced *MongoDB speakers* can miss. But it's a critical ingredient, not only of the abstract, but also of the talk itself.

> What is your point of view about the topic?

In other words, if I say, OK, folks, this is a talk about *transactions*, then a *classic point of view* might be, in *MongoDB, transactions should be the exception, not the rule*. So *this talk is going to be about when to use transactions, but it's important to understand when not to use them*. So in this case, the topic is *transactions*. But *the idea we're selling is use transactions responsibly, not habitually*.

So this is so important. I really can't stress this enough. Years of feedback from audiences has confirmed this for us. *MongoDB audiences* love deeply technical talks. But the ones that are rated the highest always have *a clearly expressed point of view about the topic set*. So now is the time *to start to uncover that point of view*. You probably have *biases, preferences, ideologies, recommendations, and/or philosophies that relate to the topic*, so what are those?

You might think of this as the **so what of the talk**. You can have *a deep, technical, memorable, well-crafted presentation, but if you don't have any point of view, if it isn't opinionated* -- we've seen over and over again -- the talk will lack impact for the audience. So take some time *to think about your point of view on the topic*. Can you express that simply and powerfully? Take a few minutes with this one. It's often *the difference between a good talk and an exceptional one*.

### Who else might be curious?

OK, so we've done some work on you, and on your topic and your point of view. This next question should be easy, but sometimes we forget to ask it -- big mistake. Given the topic and your given point of view about the topic, ask yourself, *who is the ideal audience for the talk*? And the flip side is sometimes interesting, too -- *who is this talk not for*? Both are useful.

The obvious point here is that the clearer you are about this, and more specifically you can point to that in your abstract, the more likely the folks promoting and organizing the conference will be able to get the right people in the room to see you on the day. You might have an incredibly awesome talk about *schema design for developers*, but if you give it in a room full of, say, *data analysts*, it's probably not going to be so useful.

So give it some thought. Who is your *audience ideally*? How do they think about themselves? And one thing you may want to think about is *whether this audience might typically tend to agree or disagree with that point of view you identified earlier*. So take a few minutes to define *who is the ideal audience for your talk*, and then come on back.

### A Bit of Early Content Thinking

Now that you've done some thinking about *who you are and where you're coming from*, and also thought about *your point of view about the topic, and who you hope your audience might be*, let's do some more work on the *topic of the talk itself*.

In these next few segments, I'll suggest some ways of thinking about your topic that often lead to interesting ideas about the contents or main substance of the talk.

Once again, make sure you have a way to write down or capture anything that comes to mind as we work through the next four questions.

### What are the fundamentals?

Often, when you're building a talk around a *feature or product, or really any aspect of your technical work*, you'll need to *make some basic assumptions about the content*. For example, if you're doing a talk about *charts*, you might assume that the people watching will have at least *a cursory understanding of why it might be helpful to analyze and visualize data*. Or if you were doing a talk about *indexing*, you might assume that the people in the room understand that *performance is one of the most important attributes of any application*.

In other words, with any topic, you're going to find that there are *things you assume the audience understands*. So take a minute to just think about *what assumptions might be inherent in the topic you've chosen*. This is often useful in *figuring out where you should begin the talk*. One way to think about that might be, what are the *sacred cows of this topic -- things that everyone believes, or takes for granted*?

And an even more practical way to think about this might be whether there are any *key terms, ideas, or themes that you'll need the audience to know before coming to the talk*. For example, you might have a talk about *security*, and you'd imagine that *folks would have a general understanding of the meaning of the terms authentication, authorization, auditing, and encryption*. So *what assumptions will you make about the topic, and what do they need to know coming into the talk*? Take a few minutes to write those down.

### What could be possible?

This next content question sometimes precedes from a question we asked earlier about *what you're curious about*. Sometimes talks can be organized around what is true for the topic today, and what could be true if thinking or the technology itself changed. Let's take an example from security. We recently announced *client side encryption*. In releasing this feature, we had talks which highlighted all the ways that *security in the cloud is robust*.

But if you drill down, there was *one place that security could conceivably be compromised*. That was right here at *MongoDB*. Behind all the security features, what if *MongoDB*, the company you trust to hold your data, was somehow itself *compromised*? The solution for that *is to encrypt critical data via the driver before it ever gets put on the wire and into a MongoDB instance*. And what do you know? Here we have *client side encryption*, folks. So that's an example of the kind of content structure we can sometimes have at *MongoDB World*.

There's a *here's what's true today of the topic, but what if there was a thing or a process or a mindset that's different in the future? What could be possible*? Now, not all talks will have something like that. But think about the topic you've chosen. Is there something about your talk that might have that, *"we're here now, but in the future--"* feel to it? Take a few minutes to capture anything like that that might come up for you.

### The "Bright & Shiny" Thing

This next question will bring you right to the heart of the matter. In most truly great technical talks, there's something that is what you might think of as the bright and shiny thing. There's probably something cool which made you want to talk about this topic, something that you know the audience doesn't yet know. It might be a demo, or it might be a feature, or some very useful thing that you can show them how to do. What's your big idea, or cool thing that you know you want to put in the talk? Write that down, and come on back.

### What is the value in this talk?

Our last question in this workshop is pretty straightforward, so I'll keep this simple. *How would you describe the benefit to the audience in hearing about this topic*? What's *valuable to them in hearing you speak about this*? I want you to articulate this as clearly as you can. If you're struggling to figure out what might be useful or compelling to the audience in your talk, Houston, we have a problem. I like to call this the *value proposition for your talk*.

Got to have one. Otherwise your talk is what I like to call, *what I did for my summer vacation*. And the problem with that kind of talk is no matter how cool your summer vacation was, *the audience probably doesn't care*. What they care about is *how what you did for your summer vacation can change their life*. OK, you get the idea. *Why should the audience come to your talk*? Write it down, and then come on back, and we'll try to put all of this brainstorming to good use.

### Abstract Workshop Exercise

Now that you've done some great work thinking about your talk, let's bang out a draft of an abstract, and you can go back and take ideas from everything we've done so far. This is going to be a four or five sentence paragraph. We can make it amazing later, but for now;

* Tell us what the talk is about.
* Tell us who will most benefit from the talk.
* And tell us why it matters.
* Tell us who is telling us.
* And finally, tease the good stuff, the secret, the bright and shiny thing, or what is valuable in the talk.

### Crafting Conference Abstracts Conclusion

This concludes our *abstract workshop*. But of course, your work is now just beginning. A great next step might be *to show the abstract to two or three colleagues and ask them to tell you if there are any questions that immediately spring to mind about the topic*. Pay attention to those questions they ask. Those are likely the same questions the *MongoDB audience will have about the talk*.

Take those questions and any feedback and refine what you have. This is what I like to call *Iterative Abstract Development*. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing some great abstracts and great talks in the next few months. In the next workshop, I'll be exploring content more deeply. And we'll talk in depth about what makes a truly outstanding technical talk.

## Chapter 2: Structure Your Talk

### Structure Your Talk: Introduction

People often ask me, *what makes a great technical talk*? And it's always tempting to give a formulaic answer to that question as though there were some kind of idealized form for a technical talk that we could describe. But of course, it doesn't work that way. Great technical talks have many forms. They come in all shapes and sizes. And like great software, they can have a huge variety of purposes and specific features that make them great. In the first workshop, we talked about *talk abstracts* and began to think in a general sense about what will go into your specific talk. Now I'm going to bring the focus more squarely to the content itself.

If you think about it, speaking's easy. We speak a lot, all the time, in fact. What makes technical speaking a challenge is that even though in the informal sense it's easy to speak about a topic you have a lot of knowledge about, getting people to listen can actually be pretty hard. And beyond that, getting people not only to listen but to remember the things you said and shared with them is even harder still. So what makes a technical talk exceptional? And if there's no formula for that, how can we be sure the talk we're making is going to be great?

And most important of all, when we speak, how can we make sure that people are not only listening but remembering the things we're sharing with them? Well, to understand what makes a great talk, I'm going to suggest that you need to understand the nature of the human brain, *specifically how memory works*. What I mean is that when we speak, even though audiences of one kind or another have different characteristics, there's one thing they all have in common. Unless you're speaking with an audience of *androids or cyborgs*, any audience that you're in front of *will be processing the talk in their brains in real time*. Humans are wildly diverse.

And different ideas and philosophies will appeal to different groups differently. But we all have *brains that share certain structures and capabilities*. *We tend to process information in similar ways as a result of the similarities in our brain structures*. And specifically, we have *common limitations, organizational semantics, and some special features that make certain foundational ideas about content consistently effective across all audiences*. Today we're going to do some *conceptual thinking about content*. What I'm hoping this will give you are some very basic principles that will serve you not just for this conference cycle, but really anytime you're working on a new talk.

Rather than teaching to the test and telling you specifically what should go into your talk, *I want you to understand the nature of the audience's brain and what it can tell us about how to think about content*. And specifically, I want to bring your attention to *what we have to understand about the human brain to give the audience the best chance of remembering your talk, because speaking's easy. And getting people to listen and getting them to listen and remember what you said is an art that few people understand*.

*Average speakers pay a lot of attention to what they have to share, but not a lot of attention to how the audience receives, records, and retrieves what's being shared*. So it's always fun to use analogies to database concepts for obvious reasons. *What I'm suggesting here is that the way we should think about good content in a talk is maybe something like the way we think about good schema design in MongoDB*. *The question isn't how we should organize the information in some theoretical or relational sense, if you will. The question is, how will your audience be able to query the information you put into their mental database*?

*What indexes will you help them build? And even, what level of write concern can we set on the information so that we can be sure that the things we have shared are truly written to their disk*? So today *we're going to understand the characteristics of what we can think of as human RAM, and human indexing strategies, and some unique characteristics of human disk storage*. *In other words, in order to understand what makes some content great and some content completely forgettable, we need to understand the implications of limited active memory and what that tells us about why great talks are great*.

And then I'll talk about *the specific ways that humans index or create recall, which is the key to understanding how to organize your material*. And finally, I'll share with you something I like to think of as special secret amazing talk sauce, which is the secret to creating a truly outstanding talk. My hope is that in understanding the specific characteristics of the brain, you'll start to understand at a deep level how to approach developing the content of your talk.

### Limited Active Memory

So the first thing we need to think about is called *limited active memory*. What we're trying to get a sense of here is *how much can fit in memory in the human brain*. And the answer is, *not a whole lot*. So there's various ways of measuring this. But just to give you an idea, imagine you're walking down the street. And you start to remark on the things that you see. Well, first you see a tree. Then you see a fence. Then you see a mailbox. Then you see a signpost. Then you see a dog. By the time that you're seeing that dog, you've actually forgotten the first thing that you saw.

And the way we can measure this is pretty simple. They have this really great game. You can Google it. It's called *N1 Back*. And what it does is, the computer will start firing numbers at you. And it gives you one number, and then a second number, and then a third number. And by the third number, what you try to do is give the computer back the number that it first told you. And it starts to measure how many numbers you can fit in your mind at one time. It's called N1 Back. It's a really cool game. You should check it out.

So what this reveals is, *we can't actually keep many digits in our mind at one time*. By the time it gets *to three or four, it becomes very fatiguing*. And then beyond that -- five, six, seven-- it's almost impossible really no matter how smart you are, which is terrifying. *We can only remember three or four things in any given moment*. Well, *what, does this teach us about speaking*? Well, I want you to imagine for a second *how we remember a phone number*. So as you may know, we can only *keep track of a certain number of digits at a time*.

*So if I give you a string of 10 digits, it's going to be very hard for you to remember that until you do what?* Well, it's kind of interesting. You put parentheses around the first three letters and then the first three numbers. And then there's another three numbers, and then a dash, and then four numbers. And what's so remarkable about this is even with this simple chunking idea, we're able to remember phone numbers. Now, of course, we don't have to remember phone numbers anymore, because MongoDB remembers all our numbers for us.

But when we're talking about the *limited active memory in the mind of your audience, what it means is, in real time your audience can only take in so much information*. So people who compete in these big memory Olympics at Madison Square Garden, they come and they memorize hundreds of strings of numbers. They often use mnemonics whereby they chunk these big numbers into smaller numbers.

Well, speaking is actually just like that. What you need to do for your audience is create some conceptual chunking. It's pretty fascinating. So here's what's interesting. If you think about what we think of as the iconic advice that a public speaking person will give you, public speaking person is probably 9 times out of 10 going to tell you, well, you have to have *an introduction, a body, and a conclusion in your talk*. And actually, I think that's true. But why is it true?

Well, just thinking about *limited active memory*, one of the reasons that it's true is because we can actually hold that *simple three-part structure in our mind at one time*. And what that means is, your audience has to do less background processing as you give them information. And that's really the key to making sure that your audience can pay attention to you and not really fall off the bus as you get into the technical side of the talk.

As long as they can understand at a high level the way your talk is organized, they can keep track of that information in real time without worrying what the relationships are between what came before and what came after. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to remember everything you said. But what it will mean is that they will follow along *present in the moment* as you work your way through the talk.

So this idea of *intro, body, and conclusion* actually comes out of the limits of the human *limited active memory*. So if you understand that, it's a very interesting way of understanding this iconic advice that public speaking people give you about having an *introduction, a body, and a conclusion* -- so *beginning, middle, and end*. And then in the middle of the talk, you can also use the same logic.

In the body of the talk, what we'll often see is, if you can keep a simple structure that only has *three or four parts*, then you can actually let your audience forget about the structure of the talk and stay with you in the moment, because they can keep it all in their heads at once. That's a very powerful way of thinking about content. So the simple takeaway is this. As we're structuring our talk, we need two different kinds of structure.

First of all, we need the *metastructure -- an intro, a body, and a conclusion*. And that's pretty standard thinking. And then within the body of the talk, I think we also need to think about having some simple structural logic such that *in a 40 minute talk there's probably going to be three or four buckets*. Or we might think of them as collections, three or four key ideas that you're speaking about or concepts that you're speaking about.

Believe it or not, if you just do that much structurally, your audience is able to follow along more attentively to your talk. And there's less of a chance that they're going to lose their attention and get fatigued. So that's very interesting. *Limited active memory teaches us a lot about how we need to structure and organize our talks*. Now the next thing is really interesting.

### Using Recall in Your Talk

We'll talk more about *limited active memory* in a later workshop, when we're working on designing slides. But for now, just remember that if you understand people's brains, you start to understand in principle why some talks are great and why some are doomed to fail. So with this powerful concept, you have them listening. Now, what can you do to make sure that they both listen and can recall what you said later? To do that, we need to understand how the human brain accomplishes recall. We can think of this as *memory indexing*.

### Creating Memory Indexes

So before I get into this next bit about how we create *memory indexes* in the mind, I just want to tell you a little story. So back in the 1980s, my dad was a nuclear weapons expert. And he would often go on TV to talk about issues related to deterrence and foreign policy and the Soviet Union. The show he most often went on was called The News Hour, and they would have him come on and talk about these issues, which was way cool.

So what would happen is my uncles would call from California after they saw him on the TV, and they'd say, John, John, we saw you on The News Hour! And he'd say, well, how'd I do? And they would always say, well, you look great. And then he would ask them, what did I say? And unfortunately, they could never tell him. Well, the stuff my dad was talking about was pretty technical, but it's not surprising to me that they could never remember, because unfortunately, I don't think I ever shared this bit about *memory indexing* with my dad.

So there are some people in the world who have this incredibly weird brain that remembers literally everything. They're desperately unhappy, because we actually don't want to live that way. But scientists have studied these people, and they're able to recall literally everything that they've ever experienced. So if you ask them what was the weather like on Tuesday 1994, they probably can tell you. Well, that's unfortunately not the way your audience's brain will probably be working.

There's very, very few of those people in the world. And what it means is we have to understand how people create recall in order to understand how we can make a talk that stays with them for a while. *So what do we know about the way humans create memory indexes*? Well, there's an interesting way that we can study this, and scientists have a cool little technique that will demonstrate a little bit the principles behind us.

So if you imagine just a list of regular household items, and I'm going to give you this list to study, and then you're going to be quizzed on it a few minutes later. Now, say I put on that list chairs, rugs, desk, lamp, giant ferocious angry pink mastodon, potted plants, lamp, rugs, spoons, napkins, lamps, ands I don't know, laundry basket. Now, if I gave you that list, and you took it away to study it for a few minutes, maybe if you were really, really good, you can remember everything on it.

But probably not. So the way we understand *memory indexing* is we can look across all people and say, well, if we give them that test, people will tend to remember certain things. So if we understand the things that people tend to remember, you're going to start to understand how human *memory indexing* works.

So there are really five different ways that we create a *human memory index*. The first thing that you should know is if you give people that challenge to take a list and then spit it back out a few minutes later without a lot of memorization, what they will tend to write down is the first thing that they heard or the last thing that they heard. Now, these *memory index principles are called primacy and recency*. We tend to remember the first thing and the last thing.

Well, that is so interesting in terms of how we construct talks, because remember, let's go back to our meta structure, and it explains something about the ancient art of oration as well. We remember the first thing and the last thing. So this idea of *introduction and conclusion works*, because it's *a way of us getting our key message in the audience's brain*. We're going to say it early, and then we're going to say it at the end.

And if we've just done that, and there's some key insight there, they're more likely to remember it. Well, that's fascinating. *So we can also use that within the structure of the body of the talk as we create our buckets*. If you have a technical explanation that you're trying to give, *you may want to give them stuff at the beginning and the end of the bucket if you really want them to remember it*.

So what else might you have written down from that list? Well I don't know if you noticed, and maybe it just went in one ear and out the other, but in the middle of that list of household items, there was a *giant, ferocious, pink mastodon*. Well, that's kind of weird, and it's totally unlike all the other things on the list. Well, guess what. One of the ways that *memory indexes* get created in the human mind is we tend to index on anything that is outstanding or completely unlike everything else.

Well, that's interesting, because you know when you have slide, slide, slide, slide, slide, slide, slide, and then you stop everything and you're like, now I'm going to show you a demo. *Well, that demo is actually a way of creating outstandingness*. It's one of the reasons why we like to have demos. It's because they're different. They stand apart from the quality of the other information in the talk.

It's interesting too that sometimes what I will suggest to you is that you should create *a specific theme or a kind of analogy inside your talk*. What I'm trying to do there is have you talk about something that is totally unique inside the context of the conference. So if you have a great analogy -- one that comes to mind was Osia's classic talk about Sherlock Holmes. Well, I still remember that talk, because I remember the theme of the talk was Sherlock Holmes.

Once I have that index in my mind of recall with outstandingness, I'm more likely to be able to remember the talk. That's very cool. What's another way you can create outstandingness inside a talk? Well, anything that sets the talk apart is really a way to do that. So for example, if you've ever seen a speaker wear a plaid suit, one of the things they're trying to do is make themselves more memorable inside the context of the talk.

So we'll talk more when we talk about constructing buckets in a later workshop about how we can create outstandingness in a talk. But it's something that's very important to keep in mind, especially if you have deep technical material embedded right in the middle of the talk, and you're not really sure how you're going to make people remember it. Sometimes, what we want to do there is something outstanding.

OK, so here we have our list. We remember the first things on the list, we remember the last things on the list, and we remember the outstanding stuff. Is that the only way that we can create a memory index? Of course not. There's other ways as well. So the next way is actually something you're probably pretty familiar with. You may not even know that people are doing it, but they do it, and it works.

So if you've ever heard something like the three A's of security -- authorization, authentication, and auditing, this is a memory index principle. And that is linking. Any ideas that we can link together with a certain thematic actually helps us index in the mind for recall. So if you can create simple mnemonics -- the three A's of security or things to that effect -- it actually creates a powerful linking dynamic in the mind.

Sometimes, things can be visually linked. If you have a bunch of slides with a giant yellow duck on them, we might remember those slides because all of those slides are somehow visually linked. And we'll talk more about that when we get to our slide workshop later in the month. But for right now, all we really need to understand is when we want someone to really connect three, four, five, six ideas, we often need to create some powerful way of linking them together if we want people to remember them.

OK. so what do we have so far? We've got *primacy and recency*. We remember the first thing we hear and the last thing we hear. We remember outstanding things, like that ferocious pink mastodon. And we remember things that are linked, either through mnemonics or themes or some kind of visual trope. So what's the last principle? Well, the last principle is one that I've been using throughout this explanation, and it's probably pretty obvious.

We remember things on the list that are repeated over and over again. So by going back through my list of memory principles, I've been reinforcing that the specific things I want you to take away from this section of my little talk. So primacy, recency, outstandingness, linking, and repetition all work to create indexes in the mind. I want you to go back and think just for a second about our meta-structure of the talk.

This is another reason why this ancient wisdom about introduction, body, conclusion is really helpful. We tend to remember stuff that we hear more than three times. It's quite interesting. If you hear something once, you probably won't remember it. If you hear something twice. You probably won't remember it. It's not until around the third time that deep in your brain, you've decided to start to wave a little flag that says, hey, I think we need to index this, because it's coming back often, and it may be important.

Now I know that deep down, a lot of us are relational thinkers. We believe in the third normal form and that everything should go into the database once and only once. But of course, we don't work in that way anymore -- not with MongoDB. We have a whole another way of doing things, and repeating data is actually not a problem. So I'm going to encourage you to repeat yourself a little more often than you normally do in your talk, because it's actually true that when you repeat something often, people are more likely to remember it.

Now, I know that can feel sometimes like you're talking down to your audience, and that's not really what this is. What this is is if you have a key insight, something that's super valuable that's going to completely change the way they work with their technology, you'd better repeat it several times or they just won't be able to remember it.

So what are our memory indexing principles? *Primacy, recency, outstandingness, linking, and finally, repetition*. What's so extraordinary is just working with these concepts, you can actually make sure that your talk is vastly more memorable, so that two, three, four weeks later, maybe a year later, somebody might still remember specific things that happen inside your talk. Well, that would be great. That's moving a talk from being a good talk into an incredibly outstanding talk.
